# Contributing
This project utilizes the Github ecosystem for managing, tracking, and continuous-integration.  

## Issues  
Issues should be submitted using the [Issues page](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/SimLogger/issues), utilizing the templates when relevant (for bugs and feature requests) but use the [Discussions](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/SimLogger/discussions) section for general questions.

Issues are then marked with relevant tags. First time contributors should look for issues marked [good first issue](https://github.com/joey-kilgore/SimLogger/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) as good starting points.

## Pull Requests
